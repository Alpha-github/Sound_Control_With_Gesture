# Description

Control system volume using hand gestures with MediaPipe on python 3.

**Python** forms the language on which this program is built. **OpenCV** is employed to work with live video feed as set of frames.
**MediaPipe** Hands is adopted for hand and finger, detection and tracking. It utilizes machine learning to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame. 
**Numpy** is used for Interpolation of data received from MediaPipe, which is then fed to the **Pycaw** library for System Sound Control.

### Technologies
1.  [Python] 
The python is one of the most accessible programming languages available because **it has simplified syntaxes, which gives more emphasis on natural language**. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

2. [MediaPipe]  
MediaPipe offers open source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. MediaPipe offers ready-to-use yet customizable Python solutions as a prebuilt Python package.

3. [Opencv]
OpenCV is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.

4. [Numpy]
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
5. [Pycaw]
It is a Python Core Audio Windows Library for working with both Python2 and Python3.
